# Azure Key Vault

You can find the documentation on the Azure Key Vault libraries for Java here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/keyvault 

One guide that was particularly helpful in building this out was: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/key-vault-java-authentication

## Creating the Key Vault

You can follow this guide to create a new Key Vault:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2 

After you create the vault, you need to create an Application in Azure AD by following this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2#register-an-application-with-azure-active-directory 

Then you need to authorize the application by following this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2#authorize-the-application-to-use-the-key-or-secret 

You can also do all of the following via the portal.
